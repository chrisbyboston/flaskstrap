==========

A Flask Template for Making Web Apps.

Introduction
------------
This is really just a template for my own use that has all the things I like to use already setup.
The current plan is to make the template a Flask app that uses:
* Bootstrap
* Knockout JS
* SQLAlchemy
* Postgres

I'll also likely attempt to write up some basic command line wizards to create a skeleton app as
quickly as possible.

To Do
-----
1. ~~Get basic layout in place working with bootstrap~~
2. Plug in Knockout JS
3. Build a puppet file for Flask, Postgres, SQLAlchemy (Anything that has to be installed)
